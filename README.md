# Apollo_Angular_Graphql_Start

Here i am just going to give my configuration and code for the GraphQl client Apollo with Angular.

The indications of the official documentation did'nt worked for me and it tooks me a while to find a working code for the Query, Mutation and Subscription.

It is supposed that you already have running GraphQl where Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions.

I will just paste the content of the 4 most used files when you start a new project:

- graphql.module.ts

- app.module.ts

- app.component.ts

- (just a small part) app.component.html

To this 4 files i have added the file 'types.ts' for testing.

To eventually use my files you may have to create a new Angular Project (ng new name_of_your_project) and in the project directory add Apollo (ng add apollo-angular).
